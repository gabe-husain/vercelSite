# Junior's style cheesecake


God bless the Internet Archive for letting me borrow the recipe book
## Ingredients
### Cake 
Yellow cake mix

3 eggs
1/3rd cup Butter, softened
1 cup water

### cheesecake filling
4 Creamcheese packets
1 2/3 cups sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 large eggs
3/4 cups heavy cream

## Directions
First make the cake mix

Since I am making only 1/3 of the cake mix, I am going ti be using only one third of the ingredients
This means also a reduced baking time.

In grams I will be using 125g of cake mix
I will be using 75 g of water, and I will be using 28g of melted butter, (because I can't follow directions)

Beat vigourously and then I bake it in the oven at 350 for only 10-12 minutes. Not letting the top crust.

I definitely love to level the cake with a knife since I get to eat the excess cake mix that so happens to be skimmed off

I then transferred the cake bottom to a cake pan which has no springform because I can't make it water tight since I don't have aluminum foil anyways.

I then preheated the oven to 350 since I had originally used the convection, even though I wasn't supposed to. Since I don't have a large enough pan that has sides that are tall enough, I had to use my cast iron skillet.

I bake it for 1 hour 15 minutes.

cool it on a wire rack for two hours, cover it and throw it in the fridge
Then, 


Following the instructions from the book! Especially the tips and tricks.
