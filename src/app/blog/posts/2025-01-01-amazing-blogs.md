Oh my golly

# Here are some amazing blogs
These are some amazing blogs that I just absolutely think anyone who wants to be online should be aware of.

## [The Kyle Phoenix Blog](https://kylephoenixshow.blogspot.com/)
This is a riff off the Kyle phoenix show which is so so interesting. I think the study of what goes on MNN and RCN is just frankly unfortunately overlooked. In this blog you'll see all of the most interesting articles. Some od my favourites are:
- [How is it that, in general, members of the LGBT community accumulate wealth and dominate the more well-to-do areas?](https://kylephoenixshow.blogspot.com/2018/03/kyle-phoenix-answers-how-is-it-that-in.html?zx=403915942bd230c5)
- [Dating: Why Are You Single? The Dreaded Question by Kyle Phoenix ](https://kylephoenixshow.blogspot.com/p/dating-skills.html)

## [ABC Norio](https://www.abcnorio.org/)
Deals with alphabet city and the lower east side in New York. Dope activist network and also was discovered from MNN/RCN
I especially loved the program with the short on "What would you do if you were the mayor of New York City", to which one man who was interviewed in a movie theater, begins with banning cars, then planting trees, then bringing in new animals especially tigers. Then Ends with asking for the most venomous of the snakes to also be added.
