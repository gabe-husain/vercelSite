			<p className="textBody">
				These sites are what got me into programming well this and a couple other things, they were fun ways to keep my friends on their toes back in middle school. <br />
				The login pages dont actually send the information to anyone and instead just post them to the url <br />
				We all gotta start somewhere... <br />
				What I learned from these projects is that I and my friends should always check the url before logging in to any site. <br />
				And that its SOOO easy to make a phishing site, especially as a 14 year old <br />
			</p>
			<p className="textBody">
				please don't use these sites to phish people, it's not cool and it's illegal and also don't put in your own login
